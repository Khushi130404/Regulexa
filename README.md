# Regulexa

Regulexa is a Python-based project designed to demonstrate and compare different regularization techniques used in machine learning: Ridge, Lasso, and Elastic-Net. Regularization helps to prevent overfitting and improves the generalization of models by adding a penalty term to the loss function. This project includes visualizations and performance comparisons for these techniques, making it a valuable resource for data science enthusiasts and machine learning practitioners.
